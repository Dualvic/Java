**Yatzy** is a public domain dice game similar to Yacht and Yahtzee (trademarked by Hasbro in the United States).

**Scoring**
=======
The following combinations earn points:

Upper Section:
--------------

 1. **Ones**: The sum of all dice showing the number 1.
 2. **Twos**: The sum of all dice showing the number 2.
 3. **Threes**: The sum of all dice showing the number 3.
 4. **Fours**: The sum of all dice showing the number 4.
 5. **Fives**: The sum of all dice showing the number 5.
 6. **Sixes**: The sum of all dice showing the number 6.

    If a player manages to score at least 63 points (an average of three of each number) in the upper section, they are awarded a bonus of 50 points.

Lower Section:
--------------

 1. **One Pair**: Two dice showing the same number. Score: Sum of those two dice.
 2. **Two Pairs**: Two different pairs of dice. Score: Sum of dice in those two pairs.
 3. **Three of a Kind**: Three dice showing the same number. Score: Sum of those three dice.
 4. **Four of a Kind**: Four dice with the same number. Score: Sum of those four dice.
 5. **Small Straight**: The combination 1-2-3-4-5. Score: 15 points (sum of all the dice).
 6. **Large Straight**: The combination 2-3-4-5-6. Score: 20 points (sum of all the dice).
 7. **Full House**: Any set of three combined with a different pair. Score: Sum of all the dice.
 8. **Chance**: Any combination of dice. Score: Sum of all the dice.
 9. **Yatzy**: All five dice with the same number. Score: 50 points.

    Two Pairs and Full House must have different numbers so that the combination 15566 will score 22 as Two Pairs, but 15555 will score nothing in that category.

> Some combinations offer the player a choice as to which category to
> score them under. A full house could be scored in the Full House, the
> Three-Of-A-Kind, Two Pairs, One Pair or the Chance categories. So
> 22555 would score 19 in Full House or Chance, 15 in Three-Of-A-Kind,
> 14 in Two Pairs or 10 in One Pair.
